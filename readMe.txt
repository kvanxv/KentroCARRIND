                KENTRO CARRIND UNDER CONSTRUCTION!



Kentro CARRIND is not yet up to my standards.

Work is being put into it. This is just the hub.

it is operational only on my PC as of now, on either linux on windows

GOAL: Make CMakeText.txt that lets anyone be able to use it on their PC.




                            CODE STYLE
Coding style for this project will be specific

Functions AND variables will use camelCase, for example:
    std::string longestSubstring(std::string s) {}
    int m_myNumber {};
    int myNumber;

Classes will use PascalCase, for example:
    class Kerno
    class ElectronicMath

indexes will be on new lines, never in same line unless readibility is easy, for example:
   std::string longestSubstring(std::string s)
   {
        code..
   }

   or

   std::string longestSubstring(std::string s) { return s; }
